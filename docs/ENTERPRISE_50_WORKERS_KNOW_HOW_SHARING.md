## 🚀 ROI Calculation

### Time Savings Per Worker

| Scenario | Without Network | With Network | Savings |
|----------|----------------|--------------|---------|
| Bug Fix | 3-4 hours | 30 min | **6-8x faster** |
| Customer Issue | 3-4 days | 30 min | **100x faster** |
| Analysis Task | 1 week | 1 day | **5x faster** |
| Process Task | 2-3 days | 1 hour | **20x faster** |

### Company-Wide Impact (50 workers)

**Assumptions**:
- Each worker completes 5 tasks/day
- Average 2 hours saved per task with knowledge reuse
- 250 working days/year

**Calculation**:
- Daily: 50 workers × 5 tasks × 2 hours = **500 hours saved/day**
- Monthly: 500 hours × 22 days = **11,000 hours saved/month**
- Yearly: 11,000 hours × 12 months = **132,000 hours saved/year**

**At $75/hour average**:
- **$9,900,000 saved per year**

### Additional Benefits (Not Quantified)
- Better decision quality (access to complete information)
- Faster onboarding (new workers learn from veterans)
- Reduced duplicate work (see what's already been tried)
- Improved consistency (everyone follows proven patterns)
- Cross-functional collaboration (departments aligned)
